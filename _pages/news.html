    <h3>Market Drivers and Applications</h3>
    
    <p>Several key markets are driving the adoption of advanced packaging technologies:</p>
    
    <h4>High-Performance Computing and AI</h4>
    
    <p>Data centers and AI applications demand unprecedented computational power while managing thermal and power constraints. Advanced packaging enables the integration of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with processors, reducing latency and increasing memory bandwidth significantly compared to traditional packaging approaches.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>AI Acceleration Impact:</strong> The explosion of generative AI and large language models has dramatically accelerated the demand for advanced packaging solutions. AI training and inference workloads benefit significantly from the high bandwidth, low latency connections between processors and HBM that only advanced packaging can deliver. Companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel are investing heavily in chiplet-based designs and advanced packaging to meet these demands.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Mobile and Consumer Electronics</h4>
    
    <p>The mobile market continues to push for smaller form factors, lower power consumption, and increased functionality. Fan-out wafer-level packaging (FOWLP) and system-in-package (SiP) technologies are enabling more compact and energy-efficient designs for smartphones, wearables, and other portable devices.</p>
    
    <p>Recent innovations include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integration of multiple RF components and antennas for advanced 5G/6G communications</li>
