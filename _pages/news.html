  <h2>Advanced Packaging: Heterogeneous Integration Drives Semiconductor Evolution</h2>
  
  <p>As traditional Moore's Law scaling approaches its physical limitations, heterogeneous integration emerges as a critical paradigm for continued semiconductor performance improvements. This approach transcends monolithic integration by enabling sophisticated multi-die architectures that optimize computational efficiency, power consumption, and functional density.</p>
  
  <h3>Fundamental Research Directions</h3>
  
  <p>Heterogeneous integration represents a transformative approach to semiconductor design, characterized by several key research domains:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Architectural Innovation:</strong> Development of chiplet-based designs allowing seamless integration of diverse computational elements across different process technologies</li>
    <li><strong>Interconnect Technologies:</strong> Advanced through-silicon via (TSV) and hybrid bonding techniques enabling ultra-high-density, low-latency connections</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Domain Integration:</strong> Concurrent engineering of logic, memory, analog, and radiofrequency components within unified packaging frameworks</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>Research Impact:</strong> The convergence of advanced packaging technologies is fundamentally reshaping computational architectures, particularly in domains requiring extreme computational density and efficiency such as artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and edge computing.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3>Technological Foundations</h3>
  
  <p>Key technological approaches driving heterogeneous integration include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>2.5D integration utilizing silicon interposers</li>
