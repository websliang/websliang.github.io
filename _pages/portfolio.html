<b> Study on the grain orientation effect on the microstructure evolution and failure in interconnects </b>
<br>

In this research topic, I developed phase field model to simulate and reveal the grain orientation effect on the microstructure evolution and failure mechanism in solder interconnects. Due to the small size of interconnects in 3D ICs and complicated electric-mechanical-thermal coupled loads, the grain size and distribution have a significant influence on the performance of the interconnects in service, and experimental studies have lots of challenges to dynamically track the microstructure evolution and degradation process. The developed model could simulate and reveal the interaction effects between microstructure change and field response.
